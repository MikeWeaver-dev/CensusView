CensusView may seem a bit unorthadox for many traditional coders, but it offers really cool and unique functionality. built entirely in R and R-Shiny, the app organizes millions of datapoints into an interactive GIS map. 

CensusView is very similar to the work I did at my last job. data-heavy, focused on demographics, and easy to interact with if you are not tech-savy. I chose it as my first project because I knew how to execute it and I knew a GIS project would help me stand out. I hope you visit the website and try it for yourself! Mikeweaver.dev/CensusView

Looking back on this project now that the whole portfolio is complete, I recognize it's a bit strange. Coding an entire website in R-Studio now seems crazy! Especially with how much I've come to love React. But there is something kind of nostalgic about R, and it does handle big data like a champ. 

If you want to look at the code It's pretty simple and elegant! Especially the data handling part. If you want to download it for yourself and try it, I would recommend starting with the data download script. It takes a long time to download all that data and clean it, but once you have it you will be in good shape. 

P.S. Our old clients used to pay a lot of money for this kind of thing! If you are ever curious about demographic data and want to manipulate it yourself, this code is a good start! Special thanks to Kyle Walker for developing the TidyCensus package.
